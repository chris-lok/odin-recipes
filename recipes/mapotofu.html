    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mapo tofu is one of the most common foods in Japanese homes. It's very easy to cook on a stovetop but cooking it in a microwave cuts the cooking time in half. This recipe is very hard to resist. It always makes me want to eat more rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ½ ounces firm tofu</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon miso paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon doubanjiang (soybean paste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, grated</li>
        <li>½ cup water, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 ½ ounces ground beef</li>
        <li>2 ½ ounces ground pork</li>
        <li>⅓ green onion, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Whisk miso paste, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, oyster sauce, doubanjiang, ginger, and garlic together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk 1 tablespoon water and cornstarch together in a small bowl until smooth.</li>
        <li>Combine miso mixture, remaining water, ground beef, and ground pork together in a large microwave-safe bowl. Cover and cook on 600W for 4 minutes. Drain liquid into the cornstarch mixture; mix well.</li>
        <li>Mix tofu, cornstarch mixture, and green onion carefully into the bowl of ground meat. Cover and cook until flavors combine, about 4 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
